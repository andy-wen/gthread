# Introduction #

The idea behind the project is to supply a set of classes for tracking the java threads graphically. Three main stages are tracked:
  1. The life time of the thread (when he sleep, activated, running, and dead).
  1. Tracking the objects that the thread interact with and their values
  1. Tracking thread output
